Ethernet Sharing:

To share your internet with another device that is plugged into yours via ethernet cables, you need to...

1) Put this into your configuration... "
networking.firewall.allowedUDPPorts = [
	53
	67
];"

2) Make sure this is also in your configuration... "
networking.networkmanager.enable = true;"

3) Then run these commands in your terminal... "
nmcli connection show
nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.method shared
nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv6.method ignore
nmcli connection down "Wired connection 1"
nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"
"
OR

run this

nmcli connection show && nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.method shared && nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv6.method ignore && nmcli connection down "Wired connection 1" && nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"

Then everything should work on your connected computer! Yay :D

Flakes:

After running "sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ~/dotfiles#NixPad", you will get the following error message - 
"error: file 'nixos-config' was not found in the Nix search path (add it using $NIX_PATH or -I)
Command 'nix-build '<nixpkgs/nixos>' --attr config.system.build.nixos-rebuild --no-out-link' returned non-zero exit status 1.". 

This just means that because you specified a path to a flake before, it's expecting a path to be proclaimed at all times. 
To fix this and go back to using your /etc/nixos directory, run the following - 
"sudo nixos-rebuild switch -I nixos-config=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix". 

After that your usual commands should work.

Bootloader:

These two lines definetly work, so if grub does not work, then this does - "
boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable = true;
boot.loader.efi.canTouchEfiVariables = true;"

Otherwise this grub set should work too - "
boot.loader = {
	systemd-boot.enable = false;
	grub = {
		enable = true;
		device = "nodev";
		useOSProber = true;
		efiSupport = true;
	};
	efi = {
		canTouchEfiVariables = true;
		efiSysMountPoint = "/boot";
	};
};"

HOWEVER! ~ I don't know why but grub seems to make a new boot directory called "NixOS-bootloader" which takes priority. Undoing grub from your system seems tedious and I am not sure how to do it yet. Unless you have a reason to even use grub, I wouldn't. I accidently broke my system trying to remove it - note that you should definetly read how to back it up and use the grub recovery mode!
